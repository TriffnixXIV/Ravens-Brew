### Core Rules
***Caster Training***: When you receive Caster Training, choose one of the features listed in the following sections that you qualify for.

***Feats***: The benefits of a selection of general feats are now Combat Training features. There's now a new general [[Feats|feat]] that allows the player to receive Combat Training twice.
### Spell Features
***Beyond The Medium***: Choose a spell school. When casting spells of that school, you add your Proficiency Bonus to your Spell check as if you were using a Spellcasting Focus associated with that school. You can pick this feature multiple times, but only for different spell schools.

***Beyond Matter***: Choose a spell school. When casting spells of that school that have material components that are neither consumed nor specify a cost, you can ignore the material components as if you were using a Spellcasting Focus. You can pick this feature multiple times, but only for different spell schools.

***Bypass Cover***: Your ranged spell attacks ignore half cover and three-quarters cover.

***Casting in Melee***: Being within 5 feet of an enemy doesn't impose Disadvantage on your spell attack rolls.

***Dual Spellcasting Focus***: When you cast a spell while holding two Spellcasting Foci that are associated with its school, you add your Proficiency Bonus to the Spell check twice instead of once.

***Iron Will***: You have Advantage on Constitution saving throws that you make to maintain Concentration.

***Irresistible Element***: Choose one of the following damage types: Acid, Cold, Fire, Lightning, or Thunder. Spells you cast ignore Resistance to damage of the chosen type. You can pick this feature multiple times, but only for different damage types.

***Quick Ritual***: Once per long rest, you can cast a Ritual spell that you have prepared using its regular casting time instead of the extended time for a Ritual without spending Spell Points.

***Reliable Element***: Choose one of the following damage types: Acid, Cold, Fire, Lightning, or Thunder. When you roll damage for a spell you cast that deals damage of that type, you can treat any 1 or 2 on a damage die as a 3. You can pick this feature multiple times, but only for different damage types.

***Ritualist***: Choose a number of level 1 spells equal to your Proficiency Bonus that have the Ritual tag. You always have those spells prepared, and you can cast them with any Spell Points you have. The spells' spellcasting ability is any of your choice you already have access to. Whenever your Proficiency Bonus increases thereafter, you can add an additional level 1 spell with the Ritual tag to the spells always prepared with this feature.

***Reactive Spell***: When a creature provokes an Opportunity Attack from you by leaving your reach, you can take a Reaction to cast a spell at the creature instead of making an Opportunity Attack. The spell must have a casting time of one action and must target only that creature.

***Spell Sniper***: When you cast a spell that has a range of at least 10 feet and requires you to make an attack roll, you can increase the spell's range by 60 feet.

***Spell Specialization***: Choose a spell whose initial Spell Point cost is below your Spellcaster level. Its initial cost is reduced by your Proficiency Bonus. If the initial cost is reduced to 0 or below this way, you neither spend nor regain Spell Points when casting the spell. Through upcasting, the cost can go above 0 again. You can pick this feature multiple times, but only for different spells.

***War Caster***: You can perform the Somatic components of spells even when you have weapons or a Shield in one or both hands.
### Spell Point Features
***Cheat***: Once per short rest when you spend Spell Points, you can increase your Casting Limit by your Proficiency Bonus until the start of your next turn.

***Defiance***: When Overcasting and succeeding on an Overcast Saving Throw, the Overcast Damage you take is halved.

***Emphasis***: When you roll a Spell check, you can spend any number of Spell Points to improve it by the number of Spell Points spent.

***Expectation***: When Overcasting, you roll Overcast Saving Throws against 10 + half the number of excess Spell Points instead.

***Vampiric Weavestrike***: Requires the Weavestrike feature. When you make a target lose Spell Points through Weavestrike, you gain Temporary Hit Points equal to the amount of Spell Points the target lost.

***Weavestrike***: When you hit a target that has Spell Points with an attack, you can take a Bonus Action and spend any number of Spell Points to make them lose the same amount of Spell Points. Those lost spell points count against their Casting Limit and can thus force them to [[Overcasting|Overcast]].
### Spell Manipulation Features
***Thwart***: You can use a Reaction to try to thwart a spell attack you can see that targets you or a creature you can see within 30 feet of you. Make a Spell check. If the result exceeds the attack roll by more than the spells cost, the spell attack misses its target.

When trying to thwart a critical hit, you roll with disadvantage.

***Weaken***: You can use a Reaction to try to weaken the effect of a spell that requires a saving throw. Choose one affected creature that is either you or that you can see within 30 feet of you. They add your Spellcasting ability modifier to their saving throw.

You can spend any number of Spell Points to give them an additional bonus to their saving throw equal to that amount.

***Amplify***: You can use a Reaction to amplify a spell that wasn't cast by you within 30 feet of you. Make a Spell check. If it exceeds 10 + the spells cost, the spell is cast as if three additional Spell Points were spent on it for upcasting.

Additionally, you can spend any number of Spell Points to upcast the spell with regardless of whether you succeed on the check above.
