When a creature has a [[Conditions#Disabled|disabled]] or malfunctioning body part, the Rite of Regeneration is the go-to magical way to treat it.

***Prerequisites***: To be able to perform a Rite of Regeneration, a spellcaster has to be able to cast the Cure Wounds spell.

***Performing a Rite of Regeneration***: A Rite of Regeneration is performed on a singular target creature and lead by one character, the conductor, that rolls all the required rolls, and takes 10 minutes. To successfully perform a Rite of Regeneration, the conductor must succeed on three DC 30 Regeneration checks, as described below.

After three Regeneration checks succeeded, the treated body part is no longer disabled. Instead, it is wounded until the target takes a long rest. Afterwards, the body part is healthy again.

***Rolling a Regeneration check***: To roll a Regeneration check, the conductor casts Cure Wounds on the target, upcasting if they choose to. The Spell check of this casting is the initial value of the Regeneration check. Any healing transmitted through this casting is also added to the result. If the result is at least 30, the check succeeds.

*Rolling a 20*: When a 20 is rolled on the d20 of the Spell check, the Rite of Regeneration succeeds without the need for further Regeneration checks.

***Failing a Regeneration check***: A failed Regeneration check does not make the Rite of Regeneration fail. Instead, when a Regeneration check fails, the target needs to succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw to not receive one level of Exhaustion.

*Rolling a 1*: When a 1 is rolled on the d20 of the Spell check, the Regeneration check automatically fails and the target receives one level of Exhaustion in addition to taking the consequences above.

***Assisting a Rite of Regeneration***: Creatures that are also able to cast Cure Wounds may take the Help Action on all of their turns during the Rite to give Advantage on the Regeneration checks. When doing so, they may cast the spell instead of the conductor, using a spell slot of their own.

Creatures that are able to heal the target creature can assist by using their healing abilities during the Rite and before a Regeneration check is rolled. Any healing transmitted to the target will be added to the next Regeneration check.

***Interrupting a Rite of Regeneration***: When a Rite of Regeneration is interrupted, the disability remains fully untreated and all resources used during the Rite remain spent.

The Rite is interrupted when the following conditions are not met:
- The conductor must stay within 10 feet of the target.
- The conductor must take the Magic Action on each of their turns on the Rite.
- The conductor must maintain Concentration on the Rite.
- The target body part must be sufficiently still.
- The target must stay in the space they occupied at the start of the Rite.
### Example Scenario
A Thief Rogue flew a bit too close to the sun and had his left leg disabled by the nasty bite attack of a Guard Drake that was not ready to let him pass. Lucky as he is, one of his associates is a Life Domain Cleric that is willing to help, and they've met in an isolated place to minimize disruption. Only their Bard friend presents a significant threat in that regard, though they did offer some Bardic Inspiration to help. The Cleric starts the Rite as its conductor and rolls the first Regeneration check. She rolls the d20 for a 7, adds her spellcasting modifier of +5 for a 12, and casts Cure Wounds with a first level spell slot, for 12 (2d8+3) healing by the spell and 2 healing from the Life Domains Disciple of Life feature, for a total of 26. This is not enough, but with the use of the Bardic Inspiration die the Bard oh-so-graciously offered the check total is a 31, barely making the Regeneration check succeed. Only two more successes to go, and the leg will be properly usable again!
