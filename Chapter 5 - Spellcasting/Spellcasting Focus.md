A Spellcasting Focus is a very flavourful part of magical fantasy, and it's a bit underwhelming that it is only used to substitute material components, which also add a nice narrative and worldly touch to magic. Thus, it only feels proper to give a Spellcasting Focus a use outside of substituting material components.

***Enhanced Schools***: Every Spellcasting Focus has three associated spell schools, as shown below. When you cast a spell while using a Spellcasting Focus that is associated with its school, you add your Proficiency Bonus to the Spell check.
