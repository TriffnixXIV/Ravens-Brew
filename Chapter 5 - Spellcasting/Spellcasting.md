Spellcasting is fundamentally reworked. Firstly, casting a spell now uses [[Spell Points]] instead of Spell Slots, secondly, Spell Attack rolls and Spell Save DC have been unified into a general [[Spell check]] that uses contests where the Save DC was used before, and thirdly, it is now possible to cast multiple spells a round and even upcast spells further than before through [[Overcasting]], though the spellcaster takes damage and risks [[Overcasting|Weavestrain]] by doing so. Lastly, [[Weavestrikes]] were added to open up ways to target a characters spellcasting specifically.

Additionally, Spellcasting has been supplemented with [[Caster Training]] to offer novel ways of interacting with spells and customize the character. The inner workings of [[Spellcasting Focus|Spellcasting Foci]] have been changed as well to give a bonus when casting spells of specific schools.

Some [[Spells]] have seen changes to fit with [[AC-less defence]], and some spells have been changed to interact with [[Conditions|Wounds]], as caused by [[Aimed Strikes]]. Similarly, the [[Rite of Regeneration]] has been added as a method of removing [[Conditions|Disabilities]].

***Spellcaster Level***: There are three traits that scale with Spellcaster level now. These include the [[Spell Points]] the caster has access to, their [[Spell Points|Casting Limit]], and their number of [[Caster Training]] features, as shown in the table below.

The columns to the right of the spell points column show how many Spell Points spellcasters with half levels and third levels have access to, for example when having Ranger or Arcane Trickster levels. Generally, you gain 6 Spell Points per Spellcaster level, 3 Spell Points per Halfcaster level, and 2 Spell Points per Thirdcaster level.
