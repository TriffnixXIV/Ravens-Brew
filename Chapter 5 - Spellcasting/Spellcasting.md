Spellcasting is fundamentally reworked. Firstly, casting a spell now uses [[#Spell Points]] instead of Spell Slots, secondly, Spell Attack rolls and Spell Save DC have been unified into a general [[Spell check]] that uses contests where the Save DC was used before, and thirdly, it is now possible to cast multiple spells a round and even upcast spells further than before through [[Overcasting]], though the spellcaster takes damage and risks [[Overcasting|Weavestrain]] by doing so.

Additionally, Spellcasting has been supplemented with [[Caster Training]] to offer novel ways of interacting with spells and customize the character. The inner workings of [[Spellcasting Focus|Spellcasting Foci]] have been changed as well to give a bonus when casting spells of specific schools.

Some [[Spells]] have seen changes to fit with [[AC-less defence]], and some spells have been changed to interact with [[Conditions#Wounded|Wounds]], as caused by [[Aimed Strikes]]. Similarly, the [[Rite of Regeneration]] has been added as a method of removing [[Conditions#Disabled|Disabilities]].

***Spellcaster Level***: There are three traits that scale with Spellcaster level now. These include the [[#Spell Points]] the caster has access to, their [[#Casting Limit]], and their number of [[Caster Training]] features, as shown in the table below.

| Level | Caster Training | Casting Limit | Spell Points | +1/3 | +1/2 | +2/3 |
| ----- | --------------- | ------------- | ------------ | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| 1     | 1               | 3             | 6            | 8    | 9    | 10   |

| 9     | 3               | 15            | 54           | 56   | 57   | 58   |

The columns to the right of the spell points column show how many Spell Points spellcasters with half levels and third levels have access to, for example when having Ranger or Arcane Trickster levels. Generally, you gain 6 Spell Points per Spellcaster level, 3 Spell Points per Halfcaster level, and 2 Spell Points per Thirdcaster level.
### Spell Points
Spell Slots are replaced by Spell Points and a Casting Limit. These rules run roughly parallel to the variant rule in the 2014 DMG.

***Spell Points***: To cast a spell, you now spend Spell Points instead of a Spell Slot. The table below shows how a spells level is translated into its Spell Point cost.

| Spell level  | Spell Point cost |
| ------------ | ---------------- |
| 0 (cantrips) | 0                |
| 1            | 3                |
| 2            | 6                |
| 3            | 9                |
| 4            | 12               |
| 5            | 15               |
| 6            | 18               |
| 7            | 21               |
| 8            | 24               |
| 9            | 27               |
| x            | 3x               |
The Spell Point cost, as you might notice, is equal to three times its level. This is only the initial cost, as the final cost can be increased through upcasting. When these rules speak of a spells Spell Point cost, they refer to the initial cost, and they speak of casting costs when the final cost is intended.

***Other Features using Spell Slots***: Some features that are not spells make use of spell slots regardless. These features now also use Spell Points instead, with the Spell Point amounts that they can use being multiples of three, similar to the conversion of spell slots to Spell Points otherwise.
### Upcasting
When upcasting a spell, you increase its Spell Point cost by 3 to get the heightened effect that would otherwise be achieved by spending a spell slot of one level higher. When increasing the cost by twice as many Spell Points, you get the effect of using a spell slot of two levels higher, and so on.

***Unlimited Upcasting***: With upcasting no longer being bound to available spell slots, you can now upcast as high as you like and can afford by increasing the Spell Point cost further and further. The Casting Limit described below is the only other hindrance.

***Upcasting Cantrips***: Instead of scaling with your level, cantrips that previously scaled like this can now be upcast. Unless the cantrip was otherwise changed (see in the [[Spells]] chapter), its first upgrade can be used by upcasting the cantrip by 3 Spell Points, the second upgrade by upcasting by 6 Spell Points, and the third upgrade by upcasting by 9 Spell Points.

***Unlimited Cantrip Upcasting***: When the rules of a Cantrip Upgrade describe a steady increase of effect that could be repeated infinitely, you can upcast it by 3 Spell Points each to improve its effect by another step. For example, the damage of a Fire Bolt increases by 1d10 with each Cantrip Upgrade, so you can now increase its damage by 1d10 for each 3 Spell Points you upcast it by, potentially increasing its damage far beyond what was previously possible.
### Casting Limit
The Casting Limit determines three things:
- Firstly, it is the maximum number of Spell Points a spell that you prepare can cost.
- Secondly, it is the maximum number of Spell Points you can spend on a singular spell or feature before having to [[Overcasting|Overcast]] when acting outside of turn order.
- Thirdly, it is the maximum number of Spell Points you can use each round before having to [[Overcasting|Overcast]], refreshing at the start of your turn.

***Casting Multiple Spells with Spell Point Costs***: Instead of only being able to cast a single spell that costs Spell Points in a turn, you can now cast multiple such spells each turn in accordance with your Casting Limit, [[Overcasting]] when exceeding it.

***Multiclassing and Spellcasting - Preparing Spells***: When you have levels in more than one class that has the spellcasting feature, you can only prepare spells with a Spell Point cost within the Casting Limit that correlates with the level of the class you're preparing that spell through. For casting spells, your Casting Limit still depends on your total spellcaster level. If you are a level 4 Ranger and level 3 Sorcerer, for example, you can only prepare Ranger spells with a cost of up to 5 Spell Points, and you can only prepare Sorcerer spells with a cost of up to 6 Spell Points, while you can spend up to 9 Spell Points each round before having to Overcast.
### Sunken Spells & Depthcasting
Under some circumstances, it is possible that the Spell Point cost of a spell drops below 0. These rules in turn describe the circumstances that arise from there.

***Sunken Spells***: Sunken Spells are spells that have a Spell Point cost below 0.

***Depth***: Sunken Spell have a Depth equal to the number of Spell Points their cost is below 0 by.

***Depthcasting***: Depthcasting automatically happens when casting a Sunken Spell. When Depthcasting, the spell is upcast by a number of Spell Points equal to its Depth, bringing the casting cost to 0.

***Upcasting Sunken Spells***: When you decide to upcast a Sunken Spell further, the casting cost is increased by the upcasting as usual, adding to the upcast facilitated through Depthcasting.

***Example***: Through *Trash Becomes Treasure*, a level one Sorcerer has made their cantrips cost -2 Spell Points. This means that whenever they cast a cantrip, it is automatically upcast by 2 Spell Points through Depthcasting. For their Fire Bolt, this leads to no additional effect by itself, however, they can now upcast their Fire Bolt by 1 additional Spell Point to bring its casting cost to 1 Spell Point, being upcast by 3 Spell Points, increasing its damage from 1d10 to 2d10. Starting with level 5, *Trash Becomes Treasure* will reduce its cost by 3 instead, leading to this damage increase becoming automatic and free.
