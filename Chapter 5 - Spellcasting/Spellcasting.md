Spellcasting has been supplemented with [[Spell Manipulation]] to offer novel ways of interacting with spells. Some [[Spells]] have seen changes to fit with [[AC-less defence]], and some spells have been changed to interact with [[Conditions|Wounds]], as caused by [[Aimed Strikes]]. Similarly, the [[Rite of Regeneration]] has been added as a method of removing [[Conditions|Disabilities]].
