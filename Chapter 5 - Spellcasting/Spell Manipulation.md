It should be a fun option to play a caster.

To make a caster better suited for the new changes, new reactions should be added that fit the kit of any caster without making a caster too strong regarding the damage output. Therefore, we should focus on the identity of a caster: casting spells.

With this idea in mind, a caster can use their general understanding of magic in a way to alter the flow of magic around them. This can be used to enable a coven playstyle, which we rarely see, by buffing spells of each other. In addition, a caster gets new defensive tools that work specifically against other spells, thereby leaving the caster vulnerable to their martial foes.

***Prerequisites***: To use any manipulation reaction (see below), you need to have the Spellcasting or Pact Magic feature.

Spell Manipulation requires both somatic and verbal components and has a range of 60ft.

You can only use a manipulation reaction when you can see the caster whose spell you manipulate.

***Spell Manipulation***: Spell Manipulation is a new skill that is rolled with your Spellcasting Ability. As a spellcaster, you are automatically proficient with Spell Manipulation.

Expertise can be applied to Spell Manipulation.

If you have access to multiple Spellcasting Abilities, you may roll Spell Manipulation with any of those abilities.

***Spell Manipulation Bonus***: Your Spell Manipulation Bonus is the number you add to the roll when making a Spell Manipulation check, depending on the Spell Manipulation skill as described above.

***Thwart***: You can use a Reaction to try to thwart a spell attack that targets you or a creature you can see. Make a Spell Manipulation check. If the result is at least as high as the attack roll, the spell attack misses its target.

You can spend one of your spell slots to improve your roll by three times the spell slots level.

When trying to thwart a critical hit, you roll with disadvantage.

***Weaken***: You can use a Reaction to try to weaken the effect of a spell that requires a saving throw. Choose one affected creature that is either you or that you can see. They add your Spell Manipulation Bonus to their saving throw.

You can spend one of your spell slots instead to turn the saving throw into an automatic success.

***Amplify***: You can use a Reaction to amplify a spell that wasn't cast by you. Make a Spell Manipulation check against 10 + twice the spell level. On a success, the spell is cast as if it were one level higher.

You can spend one of your spell slots to automatically succeed.

***Manipulative Stance***: You can use your Action to focus on manipulating spells. You can use the Thwart Reaction (see above), Weaken Reaction (see above) and Amplify Reaction (see above) a number of times equal to your Proficiency Bonus without using a Reaction until the start of your next turn.
