Spell Slots are replaced by Spell Points and a Casting Limit. These rules run parallel to the variant rule in the 2014 DMG, and open up design space for other spellcasting-related features that introduce more player choice, such as [[Overcasting]] and [[Caster Training]].

***Spell Points***: To cast a spell, you now spend Spell Points instead of a Spell Slot. The table below shows how a spells level is translated into its Spell Point cost.

| Spell level | Spell Point cost |
| ----------- | ---------------- |
| 1           | 3                |
| 2           | 6                |
| 3           | 9                |
| 4           | 12               |
| 5           | 15               |
| 6           | 18               |
| 7           | 21               |
| 8           | 24               |
| 9           | 27               |
| x           | 3x               |
The Spell Point cost, as you might notice, is equal to three times its level.

***Upcasting***: When upcasting a spell, you spend 3 additional Spell Points to get the heightened effect that would otherwise be achieved by spending a Spell Slot of one level higher. When spending twice as many Spell Points, you get the effect of using a Spell Slot of two levels higher, and so on.

***Casting Limit***: The Casting Limit determines three things. Firstly, it is the maximum number of Spell Points a spell that the caster learns or prepares can cost, secondly, it is the maximum number of Spell Points a Spellcaster can spend on a singular spell, and thirdly, it is the maximum number of Spell Points the Spellcaster can use each round. When spending more Spell Points than the Casting Limit allows for, the Spellcaster has to [[Overcasting|Overcast]].
