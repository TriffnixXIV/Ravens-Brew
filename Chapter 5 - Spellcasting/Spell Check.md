When you cast a spell, you now always roll a Spell check that determines the forcefulness of the spell in question. The higher the roll, the more likely it is to be effective, and the harder it is to counterspell or dispel.

***Spell Check***: When you cast a spell, you roll a D20 Test and add your spellcasting ability modifier. If you use a [[Spellcasting Focus]] that enhances the school of the spell to cast the spell, you also add your Proficiency Bonus.

***Replaces Spell Save DC***: When you cast a spell that requires its targets to roll one or multiple saving throws, the DC is now equal to the Spell check minus 2 instead.

***Replaces Spell Attack Rolls***: When you cast a spell that requires you to make an attack roll, the Spell check replaces the roll. It still counts as a Spell Attack and an attack roll. If the spell requires multiple attack rolls, you also roll multiple Spell checks.

***Determines Forcefulness***: When a caster tries to [[Chapter 5 - Spellcasting/Spells#Counterspell|counterspell]] or [[Chapter 5 - Spellcasting/Spells#Dispel Magic|dispel]] a spell you cast, they have to roll against the first Spell check of the casting.
