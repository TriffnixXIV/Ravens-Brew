When a Spellcaster spends more Spell Points than their Casting Limit accounts for, they are Overcasting. This happens when a spell is upcast to cost more than the Casting Limit allows for, or when a Spellcaster uses multiple spells or features that use Spell Points in one round and their combined cost exceeds the Casting Limit.

When Overcasting, the Spellcaster takes Overcast Damage and has to roll an Overcast Save.

***Overcast Damage***: When Overcasting, the Spellcaster takes a number of d6 of necrotic damage equal to half the Spell Points they exceed their Casting Limit by, rounded up. This damage occurs after the spell goes into effect. If the spell effect requires Concentration to be maintained, the Overcast Damage triggers a Concentration check the same way other damage would.

***Overcast Save***: An Overcast Save is a Saving Throw using the Spellcasters spellcasting ability. The Save DC equals 10 + the number of Spell Points exceeding the Casting Limit. On a successful save, nothing happens. On a failed save, the spellcaster receives one stack of Weavestrain. If they fail the save by 5 or more, they receive an additional stack of Weavestrain for every 5 they are below the Save DC.

***Weavestrain***: For every stack of Weavestrain you have, you lose one Spell Point every time you cast a cantrip or spell. This loss counts towards the Casting Limit.

After finishing a short rest, you lose one stack of Weavestrain, and after finishing a long rest, you lose a number of stacks of Weavestrain equal to your Proficiency Bonus.
### Examples
A fourth level Sorcerer would like to hurl a Scorching Ray at one particularly tough enemy, but their vision is blocked, so they use Misty Step to reach a better position beforehand. Misty Step costs 6 Spell Points, and so does Scorching Ray, but 8 Spell Points is their Casting Limit, so they are Overcasting with 4 excess Spell Points. They thus take 2d6 necrotic damage and have to roll an Overcast Save, a DC 14 Charisma Saving Throw in this case. They succeed on the save, so nothing happens.

A fifth level Wizard really wants to see the room cleared, and a Fireball for 9 Spell Points would not suffice in their estimation. So they upcast it using 21 Spell Points instead, exceeding their Casting Limit of 9 Spell Points by 12. They thus take 6d6 necrotic damage and have to roll an Overcast Save, a DC 22 Intelligence Saving Throw in this case. They roll a 12, so they fail and take three stacks of Weavestrain - one stack per default, and two additional stacks because they rolled 10 below the Save DC.
