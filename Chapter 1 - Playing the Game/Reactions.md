***Free Reactions***: In addition to a Reaction, every creature also has a Free Reaction they can use.

The free object interaction each character has once per turn may be used as a Free Reaction instead, if there is a trigger that plausibly allows for such a reaction, at the DMs mercy. For example, you can use your Free Reaction to shut a door as soon as someone has walked through it on their turn.

When you have the Incapacitated condition, you can no longer use your Free Reaction.

***Reserving Actions***: At the end of your turn, you gain 1 additional Reaction per Action you did not use. If you were unable to use these Actions because you were Incapacitated, this conversion does not happen.

***Ready Action***: When using the Ready Action, you also gain 1 additional Reaction.

***Reserving Bonus Actions***: At the end of your turn, you gain 1 additional Reaction per Bonus Action you did not use. If you were unable to use these Bonus Actions because you were Incapacitated, this conversion does not happen.

***Reserving Reactions***: At the start your turn, you gain 1 [[Surge Dice|Surge Die]] per Reaction you did not use. If you were unable to use these Reactions because you were Incapacitated, this conversion does not happen.

***Reactive Defence***: There are now options to reactively defend against incoming attacks and other effects. These include [[Dodging]], [[Blocking]], [[Parrying]] and some parts of [[Spell Manipulation]], as detailed within their respective sections.
