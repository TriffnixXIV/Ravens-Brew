A Surge Die is 1d6 that can be used for various effects that are described below. You can use one or more Surge Dice as part of any of your Actions, Bonus Actions, Free Actions, Reactions, or Free Reactions. You can use more than one Surge Die at once for the same effect. All unspent Surge Dice expire at the start of your next turn and at the end of combat.

When a Surge Die is used as a part of a contest, both parties may expend further Surge Dice at will to aid them in the contest, even after the other added one to their roll.

***Obtaining Surge Dice***: You can obtain Surge Dice through reserving Reactions as described in the [[Reactions|Reaction]] rules. Some classes may also give features that relate to Surge Dice.

***Surge Reaction***: Instead of using Surge Dice as part of other actions, you can also use them by themselves. When you notice something happening, you can take a Free Reaction to use any number of your Surge Dice.
### Surge Die Effects
You can use Surge Dice for the following effects:

***Power:*** Add the roll to an attack roll, ability check, or the damage you deal to one creature. If the Surge Die is added to the damage of a critical hit, it is not doubled.

***Force:*** Subtract the roll from one saving throw you require one creature to make. This can be part of an effect that requires multiple creatures to roll a saving throw, but it only applies to the one creature you choose.

***Speed***: You gain 10ft. of movement that you can immediately use.

***Overtake***: Add the roll to your Initiative, potentially changing your position in the Initiative Order. Before doing so, if you are first in the Initiative Order and act on Initiative 20 or before, move to either Initiative 0 or the Initiative one below that of the last spot, whichever is lowest.

You can only skip past a maximum of one entry per Surge Die spent. When the maximum is reached, your new Initiative cannot exceed the Initiative of the entry that is now ahead of you in the Initiative Order.

If your Initiative is tied with another entry after the roll, you act after the other entry.

If you are doing this during your turn, this does not lend creatures that acted before you another turn after you in case you skip past them, and it similarly does not trigger effects tied to Initiative again. If you are doing this outside of your turn and skip past the creature whose turn it currently is, you take your turn directly after them. After your turn, Initiative resumes as before.

***Tenacity***: You gain temporary hit points equal to the roll until the start of your next turn.
