This book focuses on changes to combat, including changes and additions to the fundamental combat rules. Most other fundamentals remain unchanged.

Firstly, the core change, [[AC-less defence]], is introduced, featuring [[AC-less defence#Hit DC|Hit DC]], [[AC-less defence#Damage Reduction|Damage Reduction]] and [[AC-less defence#Cover|Cover]]. Then, [[Aimed Strikes]], [[Surge Dice]] and changes to [[Reactions]] are added to supplement [[AC-less defence]], and [[Contests]] are reintroduced. Finally, [[Vision & Focus]] in combat are changed.
