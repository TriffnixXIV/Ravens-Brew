A Surge Die is 1d6 that can be used for various effects that are described below. You can use one or more Surge Dice as part of an Action, Bonus Action, Free Action, Reaction, or Free Reaction. You can use more than one surge die at once for the same effect. All unspent Surge Dice expire at the start of your next turn and at the end of combat.

When a Surge Die is used as a part of a contest, both parties may expend further Surge Dice at will to aid them in the contest, even after the other added one to their roll.

***Obtaining Surge Dice***: You can obtain Surge Dice through reserving Reactions as described in the [[Reactions|Reaction]] rules. Some classes may also give features that relate to Surge Dice.

***Power:*** Add the roll to an attack roll, ability check, or the damage you deal to one creature. If the Surge Die is added to the damage of a critical hit, it is not doubled.

***Force:*** Subtract the roll from one saving throw you require one creature to make. This can be part of an effect that requires multiple creatures to roll a saving throw, but it only applies to the one creature you choose.

***Swiftness***: You gain 10ft. of movement speed that you can immediately use.

***Speed***: Add the roll to your Initiative, potentially changing your position in the Initiative Order. If you are first in the Initiative Order, move to the last spot beforehand, with the same Initiative as the previously last entry.

You can only skip past a maximum of one entry per Surge Die spent. When the maximum is reached, your Initiative cannot exceed the Initiative of the entry that is now ahead of you in the Initiative Order.

If you are doing this during your turn, this does not lend creatures that acted before you another turn after you in case you skip past them, and it similarly does not trigger effects tied to Initiative again. If you are doing this outside of your turn and skip past the creature whose turn it currently is, you take your turn directly after them. 

***Tenacity***: You gain temporary hit points equal to the roll until the start of your next turn.
