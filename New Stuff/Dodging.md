Dodging isn’t really a thing, let’s change that.

To be more elaborate, in the base game, in many cases, Armor Class includes the Dexterity Bonus of a creature. This reasonably reflects some sort of ability to dodge - what else would the Dexterity Bonus be good for when it comes to avoiding damage? This is completely lost on many tables, as AC is often perceived to be nothing more than a coherent mass of "all of this misses" or "all of this doesn’t affect me". To add to that, defending against attacks is easily perceived as something passive due to the nature of AC, while dodging should imply activity on the defendant’s side.

Implementing some sort of mechanic that allows for reactive dodging would be quite nice for multiple reasons. It (a) makes defending against attacks part of the action economy, giving more weight to proper defensive strategies, it (b) presents the swiftness of some characters in combat, giving more flavour to their character and differentiating it mechanically from other characters, and it (c) gives the player the ability to actively avoid especially dangerous attacks while permitting weaker ones. This, in turn, allows for more aggressive encounter design.

Also, adding an option to dodge & roll would be nice, especially because swiftly jumping away from the point of impact of an attack is something that feels like it should be possible.

***Dodging check***: A Dodging check is a Dexterity (Acrobatics) check that is modified by the armour you're wearing as follows:
- While wearing light armour or no armour, the modifier is +5.
- While wearing medium armour, the modifier is +2 (+3 instead with Medium Armour Master).
- While wearing heavy armour, the modifier is +0.

***Dodge***: You can use your Reaction to try to dodge an attack that you can see and that targets you.

Make a Dodge check. If the result is at least as high as the attack roll, you successfully dodge the attack. It misses.

When trying to dodge a critical hit, you roll with disadvantage.

***Dodge & Roll***: You can use your Reaction to try to dodge an attack that you can see and that targets you or an area effect that encompasses you. Make a Dodge check and move to an unoccupied spot within 10 feet of you.

If you're trying to dodge an attack and the result is at least as high as the attack roll, you dodge successfully and the attack misses.

If you're trying to dodge an area effect and the result is at least as high as the DC of the effect and your movement makes you leave the area of the area effect, you succeed and are not affected. If you remain inside the area effect and it required a Dexterity saving throw, you automatically succeed on the saving throw. If it required another saving throw, make the other saving throw as usual.

If the Dodge check succeeds, your movement does not provoke opportunity attacks.

If the Dodge check fails, you fall prone at your target location.

If all spots within 10 feet are occupied, you fall prone in place, even if the Dodge check succeeded.

When trying to dodge & roll in response to a critical hit, you roll with disadvantage.

***Evasive Stance***: You can use your Action to focus on dodging attacks. You can use the Dodge Reaction (see above) and Dodge & Roll Reaction (see above) a number of times equal to your Proficiency Bonus without using a Reaction until the start of your next turn.
