***Parrying***: Parrying is a new skill that uses the ability that you use your weapon with.

If you are proficient with the weapon you wield, you are automatically also proficient in Parrying with that weapon.

You can't be proficient in Parrying in the usual sense.

Expertise can be applied to Parrying regardless. Then, the Proficiency Bonus will be doubled for Parrying checks you make with weapons you are proficient with.

***Prerequisites***: To use the features below, you need to wield a melee weapon.

***Parry***: You can use your Reaction to parry a melee attack that you can see and that targets you. Make a Parrying check. If the result is at least as high as the attack roll, you successfully parry, reducing the attacks damage by your weapons' Parrying Power.

If you are wielding more than one melee weapon, you can parry using multiple of those weapons at once. If the parry is successful, reduce the attacks damage by the sum of the Parrying Powers of all used weapons instead.

If you reduce the attacks damage to 0, your weapons lock, giving the attacker disadvantage on their attack rolls until either of you make an attack with their locked weapon or either of you moves out of the others range.

When trying to parry a critical hit, you roll with disadvantage.

When rolling a natural 20 on your Parrying Check, the Parrying Power is doubled.

***Parrying Power***: A weapons Parrying Power is equal to the maximum damage it can deal on a normal hit. This includes all temporary damage bonuses as well.

For example, a normal rapier deals damage equal to 1d8 + your Strength or Dexterity modifier, so its Parrying Power is equal to 8 + your Strength or Dexterity modifier. If it is also transmuted by the spell Elemental Weapon, which increases its damage by 1d4, its Parrying Power is further increased by 4.

***Parrying Stance***: You can use your Action to focus on parrying attacks. You can use the Parry Reaction (see above) a number of times equal to your Proficiency Bonus without using a Reaction until the start of your next turn.
