When a creature has a disabled or malfunctioning body part, surgery is the go-to non-magical way to treat it.

***Surgery Tools***: Surgery Tools are a type of Artisan's Tools that are used in Surgery. Cost: 30 GP. Ability: Wisdom. Weight: 4 lb. Utilize: Treat disabled body part, as described here.

***Performing a Surgery***: A surgery is performed on a singular target creature and lead by one character, the surgeon, that rolls all the required rolls, and takes roughly an hour. To successfully perform a surgery, the surgeon must succeed on a DC 20 Surgery check that utilizes Surgery Tools three times.

Other creatures can assist on these rolls, including the target, as long as they do not have the Incapacitated condition.

After three Surgery checks succeeded, the treated body part is no longer disabled. Instead, it is wounded until the target takes a long rest. Afterwards, the body part is healthy again.

***Failing a Surgery check***: A failed Surgery check does not make the Surgery fail. Instead, when a Surgery check fails, the target needs to succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw to not take 1d4+1 piercing damage that can not be mitigated.

***Rolling a 20 on the Surgery check***: A natural 20 on the Surgery check makes the surgery succeed without the need for further Surgery checks.

***Rolling a 1 on the Surgery check***: On a natural 1, the target must roll a DC 20 Constitution save, taking 4d4+4 piercing damage on a failed save, half as much on a successful one. The damage can not be mitigated.

***Anaesthesia***: The Surgery Tools include anaesthetics that can make the target creature unresponsive, giving them the Unconscious condition. The following effects also apply:
- The surgeon rolls an additional 1d4 on each Surgery check and adds the number rolled to the result.
- The target makes the Constitution saving throw to avoid being damaged by failed Surgery checks with advantage.
- The target can't be their own surgeon or assist on the surgery.
- The target wakes up 1d4 hours after the surgery is completed.
