In this chapter, new mechanics are introduced that bring the reworks of the base game to life. First in line for these changes are [[Blocking]], [[Dodging]], and [[Parrying]] to implement the reactive defense this ruleset insists upon. [[Spell Manipulation]] is added in the same vein as a treat for spellcasters that are otherwise less affected in their action economy by the new reworks.

To avoid losing action economy to unforeseen circumstances, [[Surge Dice]] are introduced here to convert remaining reactions into bonuses for the following turn.

[[Contests]] are reintroduced from the 2014 rulebook to lay the groundwork for more interactive gameplay.

Finally, in response to attack rolls losing importance, [[Aimed Strikes]] bring new flavourful options and tactical complexities to the game by allowing creatures to target specific body parts with their attacks. To work against the detrimental effects of these, [[Surgery]] and the [[Rite of Regeneration]] were added to allow a restoration of otherwise lasting injuries.
