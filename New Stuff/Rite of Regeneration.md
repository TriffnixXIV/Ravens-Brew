When a creature has a disabled or malfunctioning body part, the Rite of Regeneration is the go-to magical way to treat it.

***Prerequisites***: To be able to perform a Rite of Regeneration, a spellcaster has to be able to cast the Cure Wounds spell.

***Performing a Rite of Regeneration***: A Rite of Regeneration is performed on a singular target creature and lead by one character, the conductor, that rolls all the required rolls, and takes 10 minutes. To successfully perform a Rite of Regeneration, the conductor must succeed on three DC 30 Regeneration checks, as described below. The conductor needs to be able to perform somatic and verbal components (similar to those for a spell) during the duration of the Rite.

After three Regeneration checks succeeded, the treated body part is no longer disabled. Instead, it is wounded until the target takes a long rest. Afterwards, the body part is healthy again.

***Rolling a Regeneration check***: To roll a Regeneration check, the conductor rolls a D20-Test, adds their spellcasting modifier and proficiency bonus and casts Cure Wounds. The healing rolled this way is also added to the result.

Other creatures can assist on this check, including the target, as long as they do not have the Incapacitated condition. One creature that is also able to cast Cure Wounds may use the Help Action to give advantage on the Regeneration check or cast Cure Wounds instead of the conductor.

***Rolling a 20 on the Regeneration check***: A natural 20 on the Regeneration check makes the Rite of Regeneration succeed without the need for further Regeneration checks.

***Failing a Regeneration check***: A failed Regeneration check does not interrupt the Rite of Regeneration. Instead, when a Regeneration check fails, the target needs to succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw to not receive one level of Exhaustion.

*Rolling a 1 on the Regeneration check*: On a natural 1, the target instead receives two levels of Exhaustion on a failed save and one level on a successful one.
