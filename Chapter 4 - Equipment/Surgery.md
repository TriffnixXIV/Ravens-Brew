When a creature has a [[Conditions#Disabled|disabled]] or malfunctioning body part, Surgery is the go-to non-magical way to treat it.

***Surgery Tools***: Surgery Tools are a type of Artisan's Tools that are used in Surgery. Cost: 30 GP. Ability: Intelligence. Skill: Sleight of Hand or Medicine (your choice). Weight: 4 lb. Utilize: Treat disabled body part, as described here.

***Performing a Surgery***: A Surgery is performed on a singular target creature and lead by one character, the surgeon, that rolls all the required rolls, and takes an hour. To successfully perform a Surgery, the surgeon must succeed on a DC 20 Surgery check three times, utilizing Surgery Tools.

When you have proficiency or expertise in both Surgery Tools and an associated skill, you roll with Advantage.

After three Surgery checks succeeded, the treated body part is no longer disabled. Instead, it is wounded until the target takes a long rest. Afterwards, the body part is healthy again.

*Rolling a 20*: When a 20 is rolled on the d20, the Surgery succeeds without the need for further Surgery checks.

***Failing a Surgery check***: A failed Surgery check does not make the Surgery fail. Instead, when a Surgery check fails, the target must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw to not take 1d4+1 piercing damage that can not be reduced.

*Rolling a 1*: When a 1 is rolled on the d20, the Surgery check automatically fails. Instead of the consequences above, the target must roll a DC 20 Constitution saving throw, taking 4d4+4 piercing damage on a failed save, half as much on a successful one. This damage can not be reduced.

***Anaesthesia***: The Surgery Tools include anaesthetics that can make the target creature unresponsive, giving them the Unconscious condition. The following effects also apply:
- The surgeon rolls an additional 1d4 on each Surgery check and adds the number rolled to the result.
- The target makes the Constitution saving throw to avoid being damaged by failed Surgery checks with advantage.
- The target can't be their own surgeon or assist on the surgery.
- The target wakes up 1d4 hours after the surgery is completed.

***Assisting a Surgery***: Creatures that are proficient with Surgery Tools or with one of the associated skills may take the Help Action on all of their turns during the Surgery to give Advantage on the Surgery checks.

***Interrupting a Surgery***: When a Surgery is interrupted, the disability remains fully untreated.

The Surgery is interrupted when the following conditions are not met:
- The surgeon must take the Utilize Action on each of their turns, utilizing Surgery Tools on the target body part.
- The surgeon must maintain Concentration on the Surgery.
- The target body part must be sufficiently still.
- The target must stay in the space they occupied at the start of the Surgery.
