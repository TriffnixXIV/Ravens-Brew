Welcome to Raven's Brew, a homebrew ruleset for DnD 5e 2024.

This ruleset focuses on making DnD combat more interactive and interesting, offering especially more experienced players a fresh twist on the old classic.

This is done by introducing opportunities for attacked creatures to defend themselves with their reaction, and by replacing Armor Class with Damage Reduction and a Missing Threshold, allowing for more variance in defensive strategies. There are also rules for attacking specific body parts, which makes the attack more difficult, while offering more payoff on a hit.

The rules are made to be used together, and many class features and spells were adjusted to fit the new rules.
