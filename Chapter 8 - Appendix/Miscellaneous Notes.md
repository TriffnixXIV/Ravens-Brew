I am a big fan of calling [[Martial Training]] "Martian Training" and [[Caster Training]] "Minervan Training", based on the roman gods of warfare, Mars and Minerva. This is only because I refused to call it "Martial Training" for a good while due to its possibly confusing association with Martial weapons, even if the Martial-Caster divide is well known, and "Martian" is close enough. The other half of the divide of course has to follow suit, so I consider it the Martian-Minervan divide from now on.
