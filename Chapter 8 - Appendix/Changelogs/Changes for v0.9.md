This version introduces the Spellcasting Rework.
### Changes for v0.9.a1
[[Spellcasting]]
- Reworked Spellcasting to work through [[Spell Points]] instead of Spell Slots.
- Spellcasting is now only limited by the [[Spell Points|Casting Limit]].
- Added [[Overcasting]] to allow breaking the Casting Limit in exchange for damage and a debuff.
- You now roll a [[Spell Check|Spell check]] every time you cast a spell to determine how forceful it is, the first attack roll, and the save DC for the targets.

[[Caster Training]]
- Introduced Caster Training as a parallel to Combat Training for Spellcasters.
- Merged multiple spellcasting-related feats into Caster Training.
- Caster Training features can be acquired through Spellcaster levels, as described in [[Spellcasting]], and through the new Spellcasting Adept [[Feats|feat]].
- Spell Manipulation is now a part of Caster Training.

[[Spellcasting Focus]]
- A Spellcasting Focus now gives Proficiency with Spell checks for spells of three associated spell schools each. It is the primary way to be able to add the Proficiency Bonus to Spell checks, and thus spell attacks and spell save DC.

[[Rite of Regeneration]]
- Now uses the [[Spell Check|Spell check]] of the Cure Wounds casting as a base value.

[[Spells]]
- Changed [[Spells#Counterspell|Counterspell]] and [[Spells#Dispel Magic|Dispel Magic]] to work based on [[Spell Check|Spell checks]].

[[AC-less defence#Cover|Cover]]
- Changed cover to work through changes to Hit DC based on the target size instead of degrees of cover.
- Added cover cones to ease a visual derivation of when someone benefits from cover through shields or other small objects.

[[Shields]]
- Made the Buckler Tiny again.

[[Surge Dice]]
- Added a Free Reaction to allow the use of Surge Dice in response to any trigger without having to rely on another feature.
- The Speed option now properly gives movement instead of movement speed.

[[Vision & Focus]]
- Added descriptions for different fields of view.
- Changed the indefinite articles in Switch Focus to prevent confusion.

[[Combat Training]]
- Changed Interception to only work with Melee weapons and against Melee weapon attacks.
- Added the Arrow Splitting feature to allow parrying Ranged weapon attacks.
