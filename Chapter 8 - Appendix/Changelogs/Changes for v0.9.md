This version introduces the Spellcasting Rework.
### Changes for v0.9.a1
[[Spellcasting]]
- Reworked Spellcasting to work through [[Spellcasting#Spell Points|Spell Points]] instead of Spell Slots.
- Spellcasting is now only limited by the [[Spellcasting#Casting Limit|Casting Limit]].
- Added [[Overcasting]] to allow breaking the Casting Limit in exchange for damage and a debuff.
- You now roll a [[Spell Check|Spell check]] every time you cast a spell to determine how forceful it is, the first attack roll, and the save DC for the targets.

[[Caster Training]]
- Introduced Caster Training as a parallel to Martial Training for Spellcasters.
- Merged multiple spellcasting-related feats into Caster Training.
- Caster Training features can be acquired through Spellcaster levels, as described in [[Spellcasting]], and through the new Spellcasting Adept [[Feats|feat]].
- Spell Manipulation is now a part of Caster Training.

[[Spellcasting Focus]]
- A Spellcasting Focus now gives Proficiency with Spell checks for spells of three associated spell schools each. It is the primary way to be able to add the Proficiency Bonus to Spell checks, and thus spell attacks and spell save DC.

[[Rite of Regeneration]]
- Now uses the [[Spell Check|Spell check]] of the Cure Wounds casting as a base value.

[[Spells]]
- Changed [[Spells#Counterspell|Counterspell]] and [[Spells#Dispel Magic|Dispel Magic]] to work based on [[Spell Check|Spell checks]].

[[AC-less defence#Cover|Cover]]
- Changed cover to work through changes to Hit DC based on the target size instead of degrees of cover.
- Added cover cones to ease a visual derivation of when someone benefits from cover through shields or other small objects.

[[Shields]]
- Made the Buckler Tiny again.

[[Surge Dice]]
- Added a Free Reaction to allow the use of Surge Dice in response to any trigger without having to rely on another feature.
- The Speed option now properly gives movement instead of movement speed.

[[Vision & Focus]]
- Added descriptions for different fields of view.
- Changed the indefinite articles in Switch Focus to prevent confusion.

[[Martial Training]]
- Changed Interception to only work with Melee weapons and against Melee weapon attacks.
- Added the Arrow Splitting feature to allow parrying Ranged weapon attacks.
### Changes for v0.9.a2
General
- Updated this file :)

[[Spellcasting]]
- Explicated that it is now possible to cast multiple spells with Spell Point costs in a turn.

[[Caster Training]]
- Added the Cantrip Upcasting feature.
- Added the Hoarder feature that gives more Spell Points.
- Changed the Expectation feature to give Advantage on the Overcast Saving Throw instead.
- Added the Insistence feature, doubling the effect of the Emphasis feature.

- Changed the Beyond The Medium feature to make a body part usable as a Spellcasting Focus associated with two spell schools.
- Added the Flexible Focus feature to allow adding more associated spell schools to a Spellcasting Focus.
- Added the Universal Focus feature to make a Spellcasting Focus be associated with all spell schools.

[[Classes#Sorcerer|Sorcerer]]
- Changed Sorcery Points so that they interface with Spell Points more intuitively.
- Removed the Casting restriction from Quickened Spell.

[[Classes#Warlock|Warlock]]
- Changed the inner workings of Pact Magic to make a connection to a patron more apparent and embed the narrative into the mechanics.
- Added a more narrative variant to allow customizing the Warlocks spellcasting alongside the state of their pact and relationship to their patron.

[[Spells]]
- Changed [[Spells#Counterspell|Counterspell]] to be harder against more costly spells.
### Changes for v0.9.a3
[[Spellcasting]]
- Moved the [[Spellcasting#Spell Points|Spell Points]] chapter into this chapter.
- Explicated that these rules refer to initial Spell Point cost when speaking of a Spell Point cost and that they explicitly reference final costs otherwise. Changed the rules to actually fulfill this standard.
- Explicated how features that aren't spells and use spell slots now also use Spell Points instead.
- Turned [[Spellcasting#Upcasting|Upcasting]] into its own subsection.
- Clarified that Upcasting works through increasing the spells cost, and not through spending additional Spell Points separately.
- Removed automatic cantrip scaling.
- Cantrips can now be upcast.
- Added a paragraph about preparing spells when multiclassing that is in line with base rules, but translated to use the Casting Limit.
- Added a subsection on [[Spellcasting#Sunken Spells & Depthcasting|Sunken Spells & Depthcasting]], describing what happens when a spells cost is below 0.

[[Spellcasting Focus]]
- When using an unlisted Spellcasting Focus, you now choose two spell schools to associate that Spellcasting Focus with. 

[[Overcasting]]
- Named the number of Spell Points the Casting Limit was exceeded by Excess to simplify the descriptions of Overcast Damage and Overcast Saves.
- Moved the Overcast Damage into the spellcast or use of the feature.
- Failing the Overcast Save now makes the spell or feature fail, but no Spell Points are lost.
- Weavestrain now reduces the Casting Limit by 1 per stack instead.

[[Caster Training]]
- Added some introductory text.
- Moved some features to their proper subsection.
- *Ritualist* now allows a choice of spellcasting ability when the one who chooses the feature doesn't already have one.
- Added *By Any Means*, allowing rerolls of the Overcast Save in exchange for more Overcast Damage.
- Renamed *Spell Specialization* to *Cheapskate* and allows the choice of two spells instead of one.
- *Hoarder* can now be picked multiple times.
- Reworked *Cantrip Upcasting* into *Trash Becomes Treasure*, giving a limited amount of free upcasting to free spells.
- Reworded *Amplify* a little.
- *Beyond The Medium* now turns the chosen body part into a Spellcasting Focus instead of making it usable as if it was one, making it clear that it can be used for *Double Up*.
- Renamed *Dual Spellcasting Focus* to *Double Up*.

[[Classes#Warlock|Warlock]]
- Explicated that Eldritch Invocation Options that allow free spellcasts practically set the cost of those spells to 0.
- The Patronage now depends on uses of Spell Points instead of cast spells.

[[AC-less defence]]
- Critical Hits no longer automatically ignore Damage Reduction.

[[Martial Training]]
- Renamed Combat Training to Martial Training.
- Merged the three Enhanced Critical features into one and added the benefit that Critical Hits of the chosen damage type ignore Damage Reduction.
