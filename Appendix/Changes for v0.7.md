### New
***[[Aimed Strikes]]***: Introduced to make attack rolls more meaningful.
***[[Contests]]***: Added a chapter about them, as they were removed from the 2024 rules.
***[[Classes|Rogue]]***: now gains a new Surge Die feature on level 5: Prepared Strike.
***[[Spells]]***: Added adjustments to Blur.
***[[Feats]]***: Added adjustments to Weapon Master.
### Removed
***from Surge Dice***: Dying Struggle, Elation and Kill Rush.
### Adjusted
***General***:
- Committed to 2024 rules. All changes are now in reference to 2024 rules.
- Put the context and rationale for the rules at the start of each section again.
- Moved Reflections to the Introduction.
- Added a chapter for tables.
- Added an appendix with past changelogs.
***[[AC-less defence]]***:
- Added an example for Armor Class to Damage Reduction conversion.
- Damage Reduction now applies to attacks instead, including spell attacks. This is meant to be a buff to Damage Reduction and meant to make it more intuitive when it applies and when it doesn't. This also restores the classic connection between attacks and armour.
- Removed Dodging from the list of reactions that can reduce attack damage to 0 and thus make the attack count as a miss, because Dodging explicitly states that a dodged attack misses.
- Added a new set of smaller sizes and changed multiple base Missing Thresholds.
- Added a table as a reference for the sizes.
***[[Reactions]]***:
- Free Reactions no longer reference Free Actions, as those are not part of the 2024 rules. They now refer to the free object interaction instead.
- Using the Ready action now gives an additional Reaction.
- Limited Prey on the Vulnerable to melee weapon attacks and tied it exclusively to the Incapacitated condition.
***[[Vision & Focus]]***:
- Focus can now be switched once at the end of your turn for free, instead of as a Free Action, because those no longer exist as of the 2024 rules.
- Losing Focus now depends on the Incapacitated condition or loss of perception.
***[[Spell Manipulation]]***:
- Limited range to 60ft.
***[[Parrying]]***:
- Named the value by which a parried attacks damage is reduced Parrying Power and added a separate paragraph about it.
- Explicated that temporary damage increases also increase Parrying Power.
- Critical Parries now have increased Parrying Power.
***[[Armour]]***:
- Now features a table with armour stats.
***[[Feats]]***:
- Now offers the entire feat description.
- Moved Fighting Styles to this chapter.
- Rephrased and buffed Defensive Duellist.
- Made the changed Dual Wielder a variant instead of a replacement.
- Heavy Armour Master now uses the Proficiency Bonus, similar to the 2024 rules.
- Shield Master now forces an Athletics contest instead of a saving throw.
***[[Classes]]***:
- Moved all class changes into their own chapter.
- Moved the monk Surge Die feature to level 5.
***[[Spells]]***:
- Now offers the entire spell description.
