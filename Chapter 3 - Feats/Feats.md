Feats have received major changes, as [[Combat Training]] has been introduced as a new system for martial characters to receive new features, and many feats had their content moved there because of this. [[Combat Training]] features can be accessed through the new Combat Adept Feat and through class features, as described in the chapter on [[Combat Training]].

These Feats have been merged into [[Combat Training]]: Crossbow Expert, Crusher, Defensive Duelist, Dual Wielder, Great Weapon Master, Heavily Armored, Heavy Armor Master, Lightly Armored, Martial Weapon Training, Medium Armor Master, Moderately Armored, Piercer, Polearm Master, Sharpshooter, Shield Master, Slasher, Weapon Master, and all Fighting Style feats.

Outside of that, other changes to feats can be found here, with the full description of the new changed feat being shown here.
