Feats have received major changes, as [[Martial Training]] and [[Caster Training]] have been introduced as new systems for characters to receive new features, and many feats had their content moved there because of this. [[Martial Training]] features can be accessed through the new Combat Adept Feat and through class features, as described in the chapter on [[Martial Training]]. [[Caster Training]] features can be accessed through the new Spellcasting Adept Feat and through having Spellcaster levels, as described in the chapter on [[Spellcasting]]. 

These Feats have been merged into [[Martial Training]]: Crossbow Expert, Crusher, Defensive Duelist, Dual Wielder, Great Weapon Master, Heavily Armored, Heavy Armor Master, Lightly Armored, Martial Weapon Training, Medium Armor Master, Moderately Armored, Piercer, Polearm Master, Sharpshooter, Shield Master, Slasher, Weapon Master, and all Fighting Style feats.

These Feats have been merged into [[Caster Training]]: Elemental Adept, Ritual Caster, Spell Sniper, and War Caster.

Outside of that, other changes to feats can be found here, with the full description of the new changed feat being shown here.
