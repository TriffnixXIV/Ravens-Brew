As explained in [[AC-less defence]], the Armor Class of an armour will be converted to Damage Reduction. An armour that previously gave an Armor Class of 12, for example, will give +2 Damage Reduction instead of increasing the Armor Class of the wearer from the base Armor Class of 10 by +2.

Armours that allowed the wearer to add their whole or parts of their Dexterity modifier to their Armor Class do not give additional Damage Reduction based on that Dexterity modifier. Instead, [[Dodging]] is improved when wearing no Armour or Light Armour, and improved a bit when wearing Medium Armour, as listed below.

| Name                   | Type   | Damage Reduction | Dodging Modifier |
| ---------------------- | ------ | ---------------- | ---------------- |

| Chain Shirt            | Medium | 3                | +2               |

### Armour Pieces
The Damage Reduction of an armour will usually only work against attacks that aren't Aimed Strikes. This depends primarily on whether the armour covers the body part the Aimed Strike targets or not. As a default, wearing an armour means that at least the torso is covered by that armour, and every armour set will include coverage for all other body parts. You may choose whether you wear these other particular armour pierces or not.

***Extending Damage Reduction***: An armour piece extends the Damage Reduction of the armour set they belong to to the body part they cover. For example, with a Half Plate Armour giving a Damage Reduction of 5, the armour pieces of the same set would also give a Damage Reduction of 5.

***Light Armour Pieces***: These pieces require Light Armour Training to protect their body parts and count as Light Armour.

***Medium Armour Pieces***: These pieces require Medium Armour Training to protect their body parts and count as Medium Armour.

***Heavy Armour Pieces***: These pieces require Heavy Armour Training to protect their body parts and count as Heavy Armour. The following drawbacks also apply for particular pieces:
- ***Helmet***: Needs a lowered visor to also protect the face. When such a visor is lowered, it gives disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks relying on sight.
- ***Gloves***: Gives disadvantage on Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) checks.

***Combining Armour Types***: It is possible to wear armour pieces of multiple different armour sets at once, with each armour piece giving the Damage Reduction value of its armour set. For example, you can wear a Plate Armour on your torso for 8 Damage Reduction there and Leather Gloves for 1 Damage Reduction on the hands at the same time. Conversely, you can have 1 Damage Reduction on your torso when wearing Leather Armour, and 8 Damage Reduction on your lower arm when wearing Plate Bracers.

***Purchasing Specific Armour Pieces***: Instead of receiving armour pieces together with its armour set, it is possible to buy them separately. Depending on how much material and complexity is involved in the making of the armour piece, the cost should be between 5% and 25% of the costs for the full armour set. It is left up to the DM to decide the exact price when the demand arises, and the sum of the parts may be more expensive than the full set depending on the merchant.

When purchasing an armour set to cover only the torso, without additional armour pieces, the costs should be roughly half of the full cost.

***Wearing Armour Pieces without Training***: When wearing an armour piece of an armour category you don't have the corresponding armour training for, you have Disadvantage on any D20 Test that relies on the body part covered by that armour piece.
