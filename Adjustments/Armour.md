As explained in [[AC-less defence]], the Armor Class of an armour will be converted to Damage Reduction. An armour that previously gave an Armor Class of 12, for example, will give +2 Damage Reduction instead of increasing the Armor Class of the wearer from the base Armor Class of 10 by +2.

Armours that allowed the wearer to add their whole or parts of their Dexterity modifier to their Armor Class do not give additional Damage Reduction based on that Dexterity modifier. Instead, [[Dodging]] is improved when wearing no Armour or Light Armour, and improved a bit when wearing Medium Armour, as listed below.

| Chain Shirt            | Medium | 3                | +2               |
| Scale Mail             | Medium | 4                | +2               |

| Chain Mail             | Heavy  | 6                | 0                |
| Splint Armour          | Heavy  | 7                | 0                |
| Plate Armour           | Heavy  | 8                | 0                |

### Armour Pieces
The Damage Reduction of an armour will usually only work against attacks that aren't Aimed Strikes. This depends primarily on whether the armour covers the body part the Aimed Strike targets or not. Every armour covers at least the torso, and every armour set will include coverage for all other body parts.

You may choose whether you wear particular armour pierces or not. The following general rules apply:

***Extending Damage Reduction***: An armour piece extends the Damage Reduction of the armour set they belong to to the body part they cover. For example, when wearing Half Plate Armour for a Damage Reduction of 5, the armour pieces of the same set would also give a Damage Reduction of 5.

***Light Armour Pieces***: These pieces can only give up to 2 Damage Reduction. They require Light Armour Training to give this effect and count as Light Armour.

***Medium Armour Pieces***: These pieces can only give up to 5 Damage Reduction. They require Medium Armour Training to give this effect and count as Medium Armour.

***Heavy Armour Pieces***: These pieces require Heavy Armour Training to protect their body parts and count as Heavy Armour. The following drawbacks also apply for particular pieces:
- ***Helmet***: Needs a lowered visor to also protect the face. When such a visor is lowered, it gives disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks relying on sight.
- ***Gloves***: Gives disadvantage on Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) checks.
