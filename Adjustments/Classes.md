### Bard
***College of Dance - Dazzling Footwork - Unarmoured Defence***: When you aren't wearing armour or wielding a shield, you can roll Charisma (Performance) instead of Dexterity (Acrobatics) when [[Dodging]], and you add both your Charisma modifier and your Dexterity modifier to the roll.

***College of Valor - Combat Inspiration - Defence***: When the creature is hit by an attack roll, that creature can use the Bardic Inspiration die instead of a Reaction to attempt to [[Blocking|block]], [[Parrying|parry]] or [[Dodging|dodge]] the attack. When doing so, the creature rolls the Bardic Inspiration die and adds the number rolled to the corresponding check, potentially causing the attack to miss.
### Fighter
***Battle Master - Know Your Enemy***: Additionally, you find out whether there are particular weak spots that are worth targeting and what to expect when making an [[Aimed Strikes|Aimed Strike]] against that weak spot.

***Battle Master - Parry***: When [[Parrying]], you can expend one Superiority Die, rolling the die and adding the number tolled the Superiority Die to the Parry check. If the parry succeeds, you increase the Parrying Power by the maximum roll of your Superiority Die.

***Battle Master - Evasive Footwork***: As a Bonus Action, you can expend one Superiority Die and take the Disengage action. You also roll the die and add the number rolled to your Missing Threshold until the start of your next turn.

***Battle Master - Riposte***: When you successfully [[Blocking|block]], [[Dodging|dodge]], or [[Parrying|parry]] a melee attack, you can expend one Superiority Die to make a melee weapon against the attacking creature. If you hit, you add the Superiority Die to the attacks damage roll.
### Monk
***Martial Arts - Dexterous Attacks***: Instead of using the Dexterity modifier to determine the save DC when using the Grapple or Shove option of your Unarmed Strike, you can make a Dexterity (Athletics) check instead of a Strength (Athletics) check when attempting to Grapple or Shove, using the [[Contests|Contest]] rules.

***Unarmoured Defence***: Instead of being converted to [[AC-less defence|Damage Reduction]], your Wisdom modifier is added to your [[Dodging]] checks.

***Patient Defence***: May instead be used to enter the [[Dodging|Evasive Stance]].

***Deflect Missiles***: May be used without using a Reaction as one use of the [[Dodging|Evasive Stance]].

***Level 5: Serenity (new)***: When spending one or more Focus Points, you can instead spend the same amount of [[Surge Dice]]. You can also replace a part of the Focus Point cost with the same amount of [[Surge Dice]].

For example, when spending 3 Focus Points, you may instead spend either 3 Surge Dice, 2 Surge Dice + 1 Focus Point, or 1 Surge Die + 2 Focus Points.
### Paladin
***Oath of Glory - Glorious Defence***: Instead of increasing the targets AC, your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1) is subtracted from the attack roll, potentially causing the attack to miss.
### Ranger
***Beast Master***: Instead of their AC value, the Beast Masters beast will have a Damage Reduction equal to 3 + the Rangers Wisdom modifier.

***Gloomstalker - Shadowy Dodge***: When trying to [[Dodging|dodge]] an attack, you roll with advantage. Afterwards, you can teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space you can see, regardless of whether the [[Dodging|dodge]] was successful or not.

***Hunter - Multiattack Defence***: When you use any Reaction to counter a creatures attack, you may counter all following attacks made by the same creature against you this turn without using another Reaction. Eligible Reactions include [[Blocking]], [[Dodging]], and [[Parrying]].
### Rogue
***Uncanny Dodge***: When your [[Dodging]] checks fail, you only take half damage instead of full damage. If you fail a Dodge & Roll or all spots within 10 feet of you are occupied when making a Dodge & Roll, you do not fall prone.

***Level 5: Prepared Strike (new)***: When using Surge Dice to increase the damage of a Sneak Attack, the Surge Dice are d12 instead of d6.
### Sorcerer
***Draconic Sorcery - Draconic Resilience***: Instead of adding your Charisma modifier to your AC when you are not wearing armour, your Charisma modifier is added to your Damage Reduction.

***Wild Magic Sorcery - Wild Magic Surge - 49-52***: Instead of increasing your AC by 2, the floating shield gives half cover. If you already benefit from half cover, you benefit from three quarters cover instead.
