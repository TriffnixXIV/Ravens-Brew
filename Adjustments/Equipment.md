### Armour
As explained in [[AC-less defence]], the Armor Class of an armour will be converted to Damage Reduction. An armour that previously gave an Armor Class of 12, for example, will give +2 Damage Reduction instead of increasing the Armor Class of the wearer from the base Armor Class of 10 by +2.

Armours that allowed the wearer to add their whole or parts of their Dexterity modifier to their Armor Class do not give additional Damage Reduction based on that Dexterity modifier. Instead, [[Dodging]] is improved when wearing no Armour or Light Armour, and improved a bit when wearing Medium Armour, as listed below.

The Damage Reduction of an armour will usually only work against attacks that aren't Aimed Strikes. This depends primarily on whether the armour covers the body part the Aimed Strike targets or not. Every armour covers at least the back, belly, chest and shoulders, and every heavy armour set will include coverage for the legs and arms.

You may choose whether you wear particular armour pierces matching your armour set, for which the following rules apply:

***Leather Helmet***: 

***Metal Helmet***: 

***Leather Gloves***: 

***Metal Gloves***: Disadvantage on Dexterity (Sleight of Hand).

***Leather Bracers***: 

***Leather Boots***: 

***Metal Boots***:
