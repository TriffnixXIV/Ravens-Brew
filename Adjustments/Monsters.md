***Reactions***: Monsters have access to all of the new Reactions that they fulfil the prerequisites for.

***Surge Dice***: Monsters also get and can utilize Surge Dice.

***Bonus Actions***: Monsters that don't have any use for a Bonus Action will not convert it into an additional Reaction.

***Parries***: If a statblock of a creature features a parry reaction, it is replaced by the Parry Reaction above. Assume that the creature uses either its strongest wielded melee weapon or all its wielded melee weapons to parry, if possible.
