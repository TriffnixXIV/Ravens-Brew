***Attack Rolls***: All monsters are trained with the weapons they wield and with their Unarmed Strikes. However, only monsters that rely on their precision or are particularly experienced add their Proficiency Bonus to their attacks.

***Damage Rolls***: Monsters that are particularly aggressive or mighty may add their Proficiency Bonus to their damage rolls.

***Surge Dice***: Monsters also get and can utilize Surge Dice.

***Reactions***: Monsters have access to all of the new Reactions that they fulfil the prerequisites for. However, some monsters may not be very concerned about being hit and either wait for an Opportunity attack or use the conversion into a Surge Die to strengthen their attacks.

***Bonus Actions***: Monsters that don't have any use for a Bonus Action will not convert it into an additional Reaction.

***Parries***: If the statblock of a creature features a parry reaction, it is replaced by the [[Parrying|Parry]] Reaction described in these rules. Assume that the creature uses either its strongest wielded melee weapon or all its wielded melee weapons to parry, if possible.
