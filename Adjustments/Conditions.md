***Wounded***: A Wounded body part is more difficult to use. D20-Tests that rely on that body part are rolled with disadvantage. If a body part is Wounded and receives another wound, it becomes Disabled instead.

A wound can be treated through healing of any kind. One instance of healing removes one wound, while being restored to full hit points removes all wounds. A wound can also be treated through a DC10 Wisdom (Medicine) check, or through one use of a Healers Kit.

***Disabled***: A disabled body part is rendered unusable. D20-Tests that rely on that body part automatically fail. Depending on the body part, other conditions or consequences may be associated with that body part being disabled, at the DMs discretion.

A disability can only be treated through highly potent healing magic such as the Regenerate spell or a [[Rite of Regeneration]], or through complicated medicinal procedures only specialists can provide, such as [[Surgery]].
