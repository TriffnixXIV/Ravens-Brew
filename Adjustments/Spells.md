These spell changes are meant to bring spells in line with the new [[AC-less defence]].

***Barkskin***: Level 2 Transmutation (Druid, Ranger). Casting Time: Bonus Action. Range: Touch. Component: V, S, M (a handful of bark). Duration: 1 hour.

You touch a willing creature. Until the spell ends, the target’s skin assumes a bark-like appearance, and the target has a Damage Reduction of 4 if its Damage Reduction was lower before. Then, its Damage Reduction is increased by 3, for a minimum Damage Reduction of 7.

*Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot*: The Damage Reduction is increased by an additional 1 for each spell slot level above 2.

***Blur***: Level 2 Illusion (Sorcerer, Wizard). Casting Time: Action. Range: Self. Components: V. Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute.

Your body becomes blurred. For the duration, any creature has Disadvantage on attack rolls against you and your Missing Threshold increases by 5 for those attacks. An attacker is immune to this effect if it perceives you with Blindsight or Truesight.

***Mage Armour***: Level 1 Abjuration (Sorcerer, Wizard). Casting Time: Action. Range: Touch. Components: V, S, M (a piece of cured leather). Duration: 8 hours.

You touch a willing creature who isn’t wearing armor. Until the spell ends, the target's Damage Reduction is increased by 3. The spell ends early if the target dons armor.

***Shield***: Level 1 Abjuration (Sorcerer, Wizard). Casting Time: Reaction, which you take when you are hit by an attack roll or targeted by the Magic Missile spell. Range: Self. Components: V, S. Duration: Instantaneous.

An imperceptible barrier of magical force protects you. You take no damage from the triggering attack or Magic Missile.

***Shield of Faith***: Level 1 Abjuration (Cleric, Paladin). Casting Time: Bonus Action. Range: 60 feet. Components: V, S, M (a prayer scroll). Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes.

A shimmering field surrounds a creature of your choice within range, diverting incoming attacks for the duration, granting the creature a +2 bonus to their Missing Threshold.
