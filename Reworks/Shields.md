When wielding a shield, you benefit from cover that is appropriate for your size and the size of shield you are wielding, as described in [[AC-less defence]], instead of gaining AC. Additionally, there are now two additional types of shield and dedicated shield properties and masteries.

| Type          | Size  | Blocking Bonus | Properties       | Weight | Cost  |
| ------------- | ----- | -------------- | ---------------- | ------ | ----- |
| Buckler       | Tiny  | +6             | Free Hand, Light | 3 lb.  | 8 GP  |
| Wooden Shield | Tiny  | +4             |                  | 6 lb.  | 10 GP |
| Tower Shield  | Small | +2             | Heavy, Clunky    | 12 lb. | 20 GP |
***Clunky***: When wielding a shield with the Clunky property, you roll Dexterity (Acrobatics) checks with disadvantage.

***Free Hand***: When wielding a shield with the Free Hand property, you can still use the hand of the arm you are wielding the shield with to hold objects, for object interactions, and for somatic components.

***Heavy***: When wielding a shield with the Heavy property and if your Strength score is not at least 13, you have disadvantage on [[Blocking]] and your movement reduced by 5 ft.

***Light***: When [[Blocking]] with a shield with the Light property, the damage is not negated completely, but only reduced by your Dexterity score.
