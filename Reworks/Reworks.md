This is the core of this ruleset that gives rise to all other changes and additions.

In the spirit of interactivity, Armour Class is replaced by a new system that relies on reactive defensive, as described in the chapter on [[AC-less defence]]. This reactive defense is further supported by changes to the action economy that revolve around [[Reactions]]. [[Shields]] are also reworked to allow for more differentiated benefits, thus allowing for more flavourful and diverse characters. [[Vision & Focus]] are described in detail to encourage more strategic positioning and give attackers a way to bypass their targets reactive defense. Lastly, [[Aspects of Stealth]] are described to rework stealth in terms of various senses that can work against it and thus manipulated in favour of it.
