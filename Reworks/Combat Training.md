Combat Training is a new system that encompasses weapon proficiency, weapon mastery, Fighting Styles, Armour Training, and some Feats that interface with weapons and armour. Proficiency and expertise with [[Parrying]] and [[Blocking]] are also part of this system, as are other features relating to [[AC-less defence]] generally.

### Weapon Training
Instead of working primarily through proficiency, weapons now also utilize Training, similar to how it is established for Armour. When using a weapon that you lack training with, you have Disadvantage on any D20 test that relies on that weapon. The following features can give you training with weapons, and all of them can be taken multiple times:

***Simple Melee Weapon Training***: You gain training with simple melee weapons.

***Simple Ranged Weapon Training***: You gain training with simple melee weapons.

***Martial Melee Weapon Training***: Requires Simple Melee Weapon Training. You gain training with martial melee weapons.

***Martial Ranged Weapon Training***: Requires Simple Ranged Weapon Training. You gain training with martial ranged weapons.
### Weapon Features
***Accuracy***: Choose a weapon property. You can now add your proficiency bonus to weapon attacks with weapons with that property.

***Power***: Choose a damage type. You can now add your proficiency bonus to damage rolls with weapons that deal that type of damage.

If a magical variant of a weapon uses a different damage type to its nonmagical counterpart, the damage type of the nonmagical weapon determines whether the proficiency bonus gained through this feature applies or not.

***Style***: Gain a Fighting Style of your choice that you qualify for.

***Mastery***: Choose a weapon you are trained with. You can now use the mastery property of that weapon.
### Armour Training
***Light Armour Training***: You gain training with Light Armour.

***Medium Armour Training***: Requires Light Armour Training. You gain training with Medium Armour.

***Heavy Armour Training***: Requires Medium Armour Training. You gain training with Heavy Armour.
### Active Defense Training
