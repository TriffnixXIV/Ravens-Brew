Combat Training is a new system that encompasses weapon proficiency, weapon mastery, Fighting Styles, Armour Training, and some Feats that interface with weapons and armour. Proficiency and expertise with [[Parrying]] and [[Blocking]] are also part of this system, as are other features relating to [[AC-less defence]] generally.

***No Starting Proficiency***: You no longer start with proficiency with weapon attacks with the weapons listed in your class descriptions. Instead, you are trained with the weapons that you would otherwise have proficiency with, as described below.

***Combat Training***: When you receive Combat Training, choose one of the features listed in the following sections that you qualify for.

***Fighting Styles***: Fighting Styles are now Combat Training features. Whenever you would gain a Fighting Style, you receive Combat Training instead.

***Weapon Masteries***: Weapon Masteries are now Combat Training features. Whenever you would gain access to a mastery property, you receive Combat Training instead.
### Weapon Training
Instead of working primarily through proficiency, weapons now also utilize Training, similar to how it is established for Armour. When using a weapon that you lack training with, you have Disadvantage on any D20 Test that relies on that weapon. The following features can give you training with weapons:

***Simple Melee Weapon Training***: You gain training with Simple Melee weapons.

***Simple Ranged Weapon Training***: You gain training with Simple Ranged weapons.

***Martial Melee Weapon Training***: Requires training with Simple Melee weapons. You gain training with Martial Melee weapons.

***Martial Ranged Weapon Training***: Requires training with Simple Ranged weapons. You gain training with Martial Ranged weapons.

***Archery***: You gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls with Ranged weapons.

***Bypass Cover***: Your ranged weapon attacks ignore half cover and three-quarters cover.

***Cleave***: Once per turn, when you hit a creature with a melee attack using a weapon that has the Heavy property and deals Slashing damage, you can make a melee attack roll with the weapon against a second creature within 5 feet of the first that is also within your reach. One a hit, the second creature takes the weapons damage, but you don't add your ability modifier to that damage unless that modifier is negative.

***Dueling***: When you are holding a Melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon.

***Enhanced Critical - Bludgeoning***: When you score a Critical Hit that deals Bludgeoning damage to a creature, attack rolls against that creature have Advantage until the start of your next turn.

***Enhanced Critical - Slashing***: When you score a Critical Hit that deals Slashing damage to a creature, it has Disadvantage on attack rolls until the start of your next turn.

***Enhanced Critical - Piercing***: When you score a Critical Hit that deals Piercing damage to a creature, you can roll one additional damage die when determining the extra Piercing damage the target takes.

***Enhanced Dual Wielding***: When you take the Attack action on your turn and attack with a weapon that has the Light property, you can make one extra attack as a Bonus Action later on the same turn with a different weapon, which must be a Melee weapon that lacks the Two-Handed property. You don't add your ability modifier to the extra attack's damage unless that modifier is negative.

***Firing in Melee***: Being within 5 feet of an enemy doesn't impose Disadvantage on your attack rolls with Ranged weapons.

***Graze***: When you miss a creature with a melee attack using a weapon that has the Two-Handed property and deals Slashing damage, you can deal Slashing damage to that creature equal to the ability modifier you used to make the attack roll.

***Great Weapon Fighting***: When you roll damage for an attack you make with a Melee weapon that you are holding with two hands, you can treat any 1 or 2 on a damage die as a 3. The weapon must have the Two-Handed or Versatile property to gain this benefit.

***Guardian***: Immediately after a creature within 5 feet of you takes the Disengage action or hits a target other than you with an attack, you can make an Opportunity Attack against that creature.

***Hew***: Immediately after you score a Critical Hit with a Melee weapon with the Heavy property or reduce a creature to 0 Hit Points with one, you can make one attack with the same weapon as a Bonus Action.

***Ignore Loading***: You ignore the Loading property and can load a piece of ammunition into weapons with that property even without a free hand.

***Long Shots***: Attacking at long range doesn't impose Disadvantage on your attack rolls with Ranged weapons.

***Nick***: When you make the extra attack of the Light property, you can make it as part of the Attack action instead of as a Bonus Action. You can make this extra attack only once per turn.

***Penetration***: Choose a damage type. Your damage with weapons that deal that type of damage ignores an amount of Damage Reduction equal to your Proficiency Bonus. You can pick this feature multiple times, but only for different damage types.

***Pole Strike***: Immediately after you take the Attack action and attack with a Quarterstaff, a Spear, or a weapon that has the Heavy and Reach properties, you can use a Bonus Action to make a melee attack with the opposite end of the weapon. The attack deals Bludgeoning damage, and the damage die for this attack is a d4.

***Push***: When you hit a target with an attack using a weapon without the Light property that deals Bludgeoning damage, you can push the target up to 10 feet straight away from you to an unoccupied space if it is no more than one size larger than you.

***Prey on the Vulnerable***: If a creature that you can see and that is within your Melee range receives the Incapacitated condition, you can take a Reaction to make a Melee weapon attack against that creature.
