In this book, you will find a collection of homebrew for the fifth edition of Dungeons and Dragons (2024 rules). The core of these homebrew rules is twofold: both martials and spellcasters receive fundamental changes to their playstyles.

Martials receive a rework of how defense works in combat, and from this rework many other changes have arisen. The goal of these changes is a more interactive combat that deepens both strategic considerations and character fantasy.

Additionally, these rules will feature changes to spellcasting that are intended to firstly make the rules simpler and more flexible to allow for more player choice, and secondly to make the use of spells more risky. Those changes will be introduced in v0.9.

This twofold rework of magic and defense can bring a breath of fresh air to those for whom DnD combat has grown stale and that long for a novel experience within an otherwise well known system.
### Notable Influences
These reworks have been partially inspired by Warhammer: Vermintide 2, Divinity: Original Sin 2 and Das schwarze Auge (The Dark Eye).

They have been playtested and reviewed by some of my friends, and some features have been their suggestion. Special thanks to Magnus, Johannes, Chad, Paul, David, Noah, Lee and Lia.
