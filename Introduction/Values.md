### Interactivity
We here at we-know-what's-best-for-you GmbH know what's best for you, and that is fun, and we firmly believe that fun can only be achieved in a game where all participating parties are involved in whatever is happening. These rules try to do this ambition justice by putting a focus on [[Contests|contested]] rolls, because two people in the same action are more than one. Additionally, there are more options to react to events in combat even when you are neither victim not perpetrator, leading to more participation and thus more room for fun.
### Flavour
Another main drive expressed through these rules is one for flavour, the irresistable urge to bring something into existence that feels great. Ways to perform cool moves and through doing so bringing a character to life that feels real, coherent, and evokes awe.

This interweaving of character fantasy and in-game behaviour will be a recurring theme throughout these rules. An assassin ought to assassinate, and thus the rules have to be there to not just enable, but support and incentivize the assassin specifically to assassinate.
### Strategy
I like positional combat on battlemaps, and these rules bring new incentive to strategic positioning through the introduction of Focus, Vision and a new interactive action economy that offers a real trade-off between aggression and defence through the new defensive reactions, as well as between doing something now and doing something better later through surge dice.
### Flow
When combat takes ages and some people got nothing to do, shit's whack.
### Variety
If there are too few viable options to choose from, shit's whack.
### Balance
I don't know whether much of this is balanced. Nothing of this sticks out to me as broken or useless, do tell me where I'm wrong though.
